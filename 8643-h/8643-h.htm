    <h2>MENTIONED IN DESPATCHES.</h2>

    <p>The oldest inhabitant sat on a bench in the sun, the day's newspaper spread across
    his knees, and the newest visitor sat beside him.</p>

    <p>"He do be mentioned in despatches, do our Billy, by Sir DOUGLAS HAIG himself. If
    it hadn't a-been for him, where'd the Army been? he says. I knowed him ever since I
    come to these parts, and that weren't yesterday. He'd come round that there bend
    a-whistling, not sort o' cockahoop, like some does, but just a cheery sort o' 'Here I
    am again;' and he'd always stop most anywhere, if so be as you held up your hand.</p>

    <p>"I've seed ladies with their golf-clubs runnin' up from the club-house, and he'd
    just sort of whistle to show as he seed them, and wait for them as perlite as any
    gentleman. For it do be powerful hot to walk back home with your golf-clubs after two
    rounds; I was a caddy, I was, 'fore I went on the line, so I knows what I'm telling
    you.</p>

    <p>"It didn't make no difference if they was champions or duffers what couldn't carry
    the burn not if they tried all day. Or if it were an old woman a-goin' back from
    market with all her cabbages and live ducks and eggs and onions&mdash;it were all
    just the same to little Billy.</p>

    <p>"Then I mind the day he was took. George he come up and tells me as they have took
    Billy because the Army wants all it can get. I was fair knocked over, and him so
    little and all.</p>

    <p>"Then the Captain, what was the best golfer here, come back for leave.</p>

    <p>"'Grandpa,' says he, same as he always call me&mdash;'Grandpa,' he says, 'I've
    been thinking about Billy all the time I've been out, and longing to hear him whistle
    again, and now I'm home and he's gone. I shall have to get back to France again to
    see him.'</p>

    <p>"So he will, Sir, and if Billy was going up right under the German guns it's my
    belief as Captain would get out of his trench to go and see him.</p>

    <p>"What regiment is Billy in, did you say, Sir? Why, he got no regiment. Ain't I
    been telling you, Sir, 'Puffing Billy' is what our golfers here call the little train
    what used to run six times a day from the town to the links. Just see what the paper
    says, Sir. I don't be much of a reader, but hark ye to this: 'I wish also to place on
    record here the fact that the successful solution of the problem of railway transport
    would have been impossible had it not been for the patriotism of the railway
    companies at home. They did not hesitate to give up their locomotives and rolling
    stock.'</p>

    <p>"That's 'Puffing Billy,' Sir, him what I've put the signal down for hundreds an'
    hundreds of times. I miss him powerful bad, but the Army wanted him, and we've been
    and got some thanks too. I'm proud to think my Billy's in the paper."</p>

    <h2>LE S&Eacute;N&Eacute;GALAIS.</h2>

    <p>Sam&eacute;dou Kieta sat up in bed with a child's primer open before him.
    "M&mdash;A," he spelled. Then, after an incredibly long time of patient puzzling,
    "M&mdash;A&mdash;MA. Oui, MA. Y a bon!" and embraced the whole ward in one wide white
    grin before turning to the next syllable, "M&mdash;A&mdash;N." Once more the puzzled
    frown on the black face, once more the whispered hints from neighbouring beds, once
    more the triumph of perseverance, "M&mdash;A&mdash;N&mdash;MAN!" He was just enjoying
    his success and chanting his pidgin-French paean of happiness, "Y a bon! Y a bon!"
    when Soeur Antoinette paused by his bed. "Tr&egrave;s bien, Sidi," she said, "mais il
    faut les mettre ensemble," and with her white finger she guided his black one back to
    the first syllable.</p>

    <p>Here was difficulty indeed! He knew all right that M&mdash;A&mdash;N was MAN, but
    what was M&mdash;A? And when, after intense effort, he re-discovered that M&mdash;A
    spelled MA, it was only to find that he had forgotten what M&mdash;A&mdash;N spelled.
    At last the other wounded could contain themselves no longer, and the ward was filled
    with laughing shouts of "Maman!" in which Sam&eacute;dou joined most happily.</p>

    <p>Presently the English nurse passed the negro's bed, and he at once turned to
    another branch of learning. "Good morning," he said, and, when she smiled back a
    greeting to him, he added, "T'ank you," and looked proudly round him at his
    fellow-patients as who should say, "See how we understand one another, she and
    I!"</p>

    <p>During a sojourn of many months in the hospital Sam&eacute;dou invariably met the
    sufferings he was called upon to endure with an uncomplaining fortitude, which might
    have seemed due to insensibility had not the staff had ample proof that his silence
    was the silence of a fine courage. On one occasion a set of photographs of the
    hospital was in preparation, and when the <i>salle de pansements</i> had to be taken
    the photographer decided that the best lay figure for his <i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i>
    would be a black man, as a striking contrast to the white raiment of the staff. So
    Sam&eacute;dou was carried in on a stretcher and laid upon the table. Unfortunately
    the surgeons and nurses were so occupied with the business of placing things in the
    best light that no one realised that the poor Senegalese did not understand the
    purpose of the preparations, and when the English nurse was called to take up her
    position she noticed the hands of Sam&eacute;dou Kieta clutching the sides of the
    table and his black eyes rolling in a sea of white.</p>

    <p>She at once ran to the nearest ward. "Quelqu'un voudrait bien me pr&ecirc;ter une
    photographie?" she asked, and a dozen eager hands offered her the treasured groups of
    <i>la famille</i>. Taking one at random she returned to Sam&eacute;dou and held it
    before his eyes. "Nous aussi," she said, "toi, moi, le Major, l'infirmier."</p>

    <p>Sam&eacute;dou looked, and a heavenly relief chased the tension from his face. "Y
    a bon," he said happily. "Toi, bon camarade!"</p>

    <p>When his wounds began to be less painful the problem was how to keep the Sidi in
    bed. No one cared to be very severe with him, so the staff resorted to the usual weak
    method of confiscating all his clothes save a shirt, and hoping for the best. But one
    day the English nurse, going unexpectedly into a distant ward, came upon
    Sam&eacute;dou Kieta, simply dressed in a single shirt and a bandage, visiting the
    freshly-arrived wounded and scattering wide grins around him. At her horrified
    exclamation he began to shrivel away towards the door, ushering himself out with the
    propitiatory words, "Good morning. Good night. T'ank you. Water!" A most effectual
    method of disarming reproof.</p>

    <p>Poor Sam&eacute;dou has since passed on to another hospital for electric
    treatment, but the staff still treasures his first and only letter:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Moi, Sam&eacute;dou Kieta, arriv&eacute; &agrave; l'autre h&ocirc;pital. Y a bon.
    Mais moi, Sam&eacute;dou Kieta, toi pas oubli&eacute;. Merci, Monsieur le Major deux
    galons. Merci, Soeur Antoinette. Merci, Madame l'Anglaise. Y a bon. Y a bon. Y a
    bon."</p>

    <h4>(<i>Embodying divers quotations from the poems of G.K.C.</i>)</h4>

    <blockquote>
      Methinks at last the time has come to speak ...<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Since good old Russia up and revoluted<br />
      I have been waiting, week by weary week,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; To hear the news&mdash;the obvious item&mdash;bruited;<br />
      But now I give it up; it will not come;<br />
      Or anyway I can no more be dumb.<br />

      &nbsp;&nbsp; "Freedom in arms, the riding and the routing,"<br />
      Demos superbly potting at police,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And actual swords getting an actual outing&mdash;<br />
      Came at the last, the things wherein you shone,<br />
      Or let us think you'd shine in, CHESTERTON?<br />
      <br />

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Alas for us whose faith refused to doubt you!<br />

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Managed, somehow, to get along without you;<br />
      When Russia "went to battle for the creed"<br />
      GILBERT sat tight and did not even bleed!<br />
      <br />
      CHESTERTON! Dash it all, my dear old chap!<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Why, weren't you always eloquent on "Valmy,"<br />
      "Death and the splendour of the scarlet cap"?<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Here were the days you looked upon as palmy.<br />
      Just think of all your poems! Why, good Lord,<br />
      There is no word you work so hard as "sword."<br />
      <br />
      We looked to see you there, the stout and staunch,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; "Red flag" in one hand and "ten swords" in t'other;<br />
      Saw the strong sword-belt bursting from your paunch;<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Pitied the foes you'd fall upon and smother;<br />
      Heard you make droves of pale policemen bleat,<br />
      Running amok to "slay them in the street."<br />
      <br />
      Strong athwart Heav'n ran the high barricades,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And giant Bastilles reeled, impossibly smitten,<br />
      And men with broken hands swung thunderous blades<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; In "Russia's wrath"&mdash;just as you've often written;<br />

    <h2>WOMAN AS USUAL.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>In the manner of some of our own evening papers</i>.)</h4>

    <p>It was with a real pang that I tore myself away from the Frugality Exhibition,
    where the culinary demonstrations were most enthralling. Just before leaving,
    however, I watched a wonderfully tasty hash being compounded with oddments of rabbit
    and banana flour. It exhaled an aroma which I hated to leave&mdash;even for luncheon
    at the Fitz.</p>

    <h4>AT THE FITZ.</h4>

    <p>By a strange coincidence I made the acquaintance of an admirable rabbit
    <i>goulash</i>, which was, I believe, identical with that which I saw being prepared
    at the Frugality Exhibition. Thus extremes meet, and the fusion of classes is happily
    illustrated in the common use of the same comestibles.</p>

    <p>There are always a number of people lunching in the great hotels in these war-time
    days, and I was glad to see Lady Allchin, looking remarkably well-nourished in a
    mauve Graeco-Roman dress and Gainsborough hat; Lady Waterstock, Lord Hilary Sprockett
    and Sir Peter Frye-Smith.</p>

    <h4>YESTERDAY'S WEDDING.</h4>

    <p>Lady Carmilla Dunstable made a lovely bride at St. Mungo's, Belgravia, yesterday,
    on her marriage to Prince Wurra-Wurra, of Tierra-del-Fuego. The story of the
    engagement is wildly romantic. Lady Carmilla was returning from Peru, where she had
    been hunting armadillos; the ship in which she was travelling was wrecked in the
    Straits of Magellan, and she was rescued by Prince Wurra-Wurra, who was casually
    cruising about in his catamaran. Her family were for some time hostile to the match,
    but all objections were soon removed, as the Prince has abjured cannibalism and is
    now an uncompromising vegetarian. The bridegroom, who is a fine-looking man of the
    prognathous type, was loudly cheered by the crowd on leaving the church.</p>

    <h4>A CHARMING CONCERT.</h4>

    <p>All true melomaniacs will rejoice to hear that the Signora Balmi-Dotti has decided
    to give another vocal recital at the Dorian Hall. Her programme as usual reflects her
    catholic and cosmopolitan taste, for she will sing not only Welsh and Cornish
    folk-songs, but works by PALESTRINA, Gasolini, Larranaga, Sparafucile, and the young
    American composer, Ploffskin Jee, so that both classical and modern masters will be
    represented.</p>

    <h4>TWO RECIPES FOR TEA CAKES.</h4>

    <p>The FOOD CONTROLLER looks askance at teas in these days, but in hot weather, when
    luncheon is reduced to the lowest common denominator and dinner resolves itself into
    a cold collation in the cool of the evening, some refreshment between our second and
    third meals is indispensable. I accordingly give two recipes which need no wheaten
    flour and are very quickly made.</p>

    <p>Take half-a-pound of sugar, a quarter of caviare, a quarter of calipash, a quarter
    of millet and six peaches. Beat the caviare to a cream and pound the peaches to a
    pulp; then add the sugar and millet and stir vigorously with a mirliton. Put into
    patty-pans and bake gently for about thirty minutes in an electric silo-oven. About
    thirty cakes should result; but more will materialize if you increase the ingredients
    proportionately.</p>

    <p>Take two kilowatts of ammoniated quinine and beat up with one very large
    egg&mdash;a swan's for choice. Add gradually ten ounces of piperazine, a pint of
    Harrogate water and inhale leisurely through a zoetrope.</p>

      <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

      <p><i>Monday, June 25th</i>.&mdash;Mr. LYNCH is beginning to pine for the return of
      Lord ROBERT CECIL. He does not quite know what to make of Mr. BALFOUR, who politely
      represses his honest endeavours to elucidate the situation in Greece, and actually
      declared to-day that the difficulties of the Allies would only be increased by the
      hon. Member's attempts to deal with them piecemeal. Mr. LYNCH was not entirely done
      with, however. "Is that reply," he asked in a "got-him-this-time" manner, "given by
      reason of freedom of choice or ineludible necessity?" "Sir," replied the apologist
      of philosophic doubt with Johnsonian authority, "questions of freewill and
      necessity have perplexed mankind for ages."</p>

      <p>The House will be delighted to welcome back to its fold Sir ROBERT HERMAN-HODGE,
      whose flowing moustaches, once described as "the best definition of infinity," have
      been, at intervals, its pride and joy for over thirty years. But it will have to
      wait a while, for&mdash;strange lapse on the part of a hero of half-a-dozen
      contests!&mdash;Sir ROBERT had omitted to bring with him the returning-officer's
      certificate. Lord HALSBURY, delayed by a similar accident on his first appearance

      Mr. DILLON prefers to attack the Government at Westminster, because it proposes to
      set up a Conference to consider the future composition and powers of the Second
      Chamber. Was it not, he asked, a breach of privilege to do this without the express
      consent of the House of Commons? The SPEAKER thought not, and referred his
      questioner to the preamble of the Parliament Act of 1911, in which such action was
      distinctly contemplated. Mr. DILLON, thus suddenly transported to the dear dead
      days before the War, when he was hand-in-glove with the present PRIME MINISTER,
      considers that Mr. LOWTHER is open to censure for possessing a memory of such

      been successful he would have been recorded in history as the mildest-mannered man
      that ever bombed a German baby. But Lord DERBY would have none of it. British
      aeroplanes&mdash;of which, like every nation engaged in the War, we have none too

      THE RIVALS. MR. BRACE. SIR ROBERT HERMAN-HODGE.</p>

      <p>After much consultation with the military authorities the Government has decided
      that to issue general warnings on the occasion of an air-raid would tend to do more
      harm than good; and the LORD MAYOR (<i>teste</i> Mr. CATHCART WASON) has announced
      that he will not ring the great bell of St. Paul's. The DEAN and Chapter, while
      regretting that Sir WILLIAM DUNN should be deprived of a health-giving exercise,
      had, as a point of fact, declined to countenance his contemplated invasion of their
      belfry.</p>

      A FIRM CHIN IN ANNIE'S DEFENCE. COMMANDER WEDGWOOD.</p>

      <p>Commander WEDGWOOD, I am sorry to observe, has almost exhausted the store of
      commonsense that he brought back with him from the trenches at Gallipoli. Otherwise
      he would hardly have championed the cause of Mrs. ANNIE BESANT, upon whose
      activities the Government of Madras have imposed certain salutary restrictions.
      What India wants, I understand, is less Besant and more Rice.</p>

      <p>Now that young soldiers are to have votes as a reward for fighting there is
      logically a strong argument for taking away the franchise from those who have
      refused to fight. It was well expressed by Mr. RONALD MCNEILL and others, but,
      apart from the objections urged on high religious grounds by Lord HUGH CECIL, the
      Government was probably right in resisting the proposal. Parliament made a mistake
      in ever giving a statutory exemption to the conscientious objector. The most that
      person could claim was that he should not be called upon to take other people's
      lives; he had no right to be excused from risking his own. But having deliberately
      provided a loophole it is hardly fair for Parliament to inflict a penalty upon
      those who creep through it. And so the House thought, for it rejected the proposal
      by a two-to-one majority.</p>

      <p><i>Wednesday, June 27th</i>.&mdash;There is a general impression that membership
      of the House of Commons is in itself a sufficient excuse for the avoidance of
      military service. This, it appears, is erroneous. Only those are exempt whom a
      Medical Board has declared unfit for general service; and even these, according to
      Mr. FORSTER, may now be re-examined. This ought to prove a great comfort to certain
      potential heroes.</p>

      <p><i>Thursday, June 28th</i>.&mdash;Mr. JOSEPH KING'S chief concern at the moment
      is to get Lord HARDINGE removed from the Foreign Office, where he suspects him of
      concocting the devastating answers with which Mr. BALFOUR represses impertinent
      curiosity. Accordingly he raked up the old story of Lord HARDINGE'S letter to Sir
      G. BUCHANAN, and inquired what action the FOREIGN SECRETARY proposed to take. Mr.
      BALFOUR proposed to take no action. The letter was a private communication, which
      would never have been heard of but for its capture by a German submarine. Even Mr.
      KING'S own correspondence, he suggested, could hardly be so dull that everything in
      it would bear publication.</p>

      <p>Mr. KING justly resented this imputation. Dull? Why, only this week his
      letter-bag brought him news of the great reception accorded in Petrograd to one
      TROTSKY, on his release from internment; and would the HOME SECRETARY be more
      careful, please, about interning alien friends without trial? Sir George Cave was
      sorry, but he had never heard of TROTSKY. There was a certain KAUTSKY, who had been
      interned&mdash;by the Germans. Perhaps Mr. King would address himself to them.</p>

      <p>The MINISTER OF MUNITIONS had a good audience for his review of the wonderful
      work of his department. Who could refuse the chance of listening to ADDISON on
      Steel? I cannot honestly say that the result of this combination was quite so
      sparkling as it should have been, for the orator stuck closely to his manuscript
      and allowed himself few flights of fancy. But the facts spoke for themselves, and
      the House readily endorsed the verdict already given by Vimy Ridge and
      Messines.</p>

      <h2>THE TWO MISSING NUMBERS.</h2>

      <h3>A CONTRAST.</h3>

      <h4>I.</h4>
      My friend X. is normally the mildest of men. His temper is under perfect control;
      and in his favourite part of the angels' advocate he finds palliations and makes
      allowances for all those defections in the servants of the public which goad men to
      fury and which, since the War came in to supply incompetence with a cloak and a
      pretext, have been exasperatingly on the increase. Thus, serene and considerate,
      has X. gone his uncomplaining way for years.

      <p>But yesterday I found him on the kerb in the Strand inarticulate and purple with
      rage. His face was hardly recognisable, so distorted were those ordinarily placid
      features. His eyes were fixed on a receding taxi.</p>

      <p>Fearing that he might be ill I took his arm; but he flung himself free. "Don't
      touch me," he said; "I can't bear it." Having reached a point in life when tact is
      second nature, I waited silently near him until the storm should have passed.</p>

      <p>His eyes were still fixed.</p>

      <p>After a short time he recovered sufficiently to turn to me and explain.</p>

      <p>"I could have killed that fellow," he said.</p>

      <p>"What fellow?"</p>

      <p>"That taxi-driver. He went by slowly with his flag up and wouldn't look at me. I
      hailed him, and I know he heard, but he wouldn't look at me. Now I don't mind when
      they point, or make any kind of sign that they don't want to be hired, or say that
      they have no petrol, even if I don't believe it; but when they won't turn their
      heads or pay any attention whatever I could kill them. And there's such a lot of
      them like that. I swear," he went on, beginning to go purple again&mdash;"I swear
      that, if I had had a revolver just now, I should have shot him. When one man hails
      another, the man who is hailed must give some kind of an indication. It's only
      human. Society would fall to pieces if we all behaved like that chap. It's awful,
      awful! If I'd only thought of taking his number I'd run him in, and I'd carry it to
      the House of Lords if necessary. Such men&mdash;ugh!"</p>

      <p>He broke down, smothered by righteous anger.</p>

      <p>"Good heavens!" he exclaimed as I was leaving, "if I'd only taken his number!
      "</p>

      <h4>II.</h4>

      <p>The same night a miracle happened. It was very late, and the
      <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of a little charity performance at an assembly-room had to be
      cleared away. The last guests had gone&mdash;in this or that conveyance, or on our
      best friends in war-time, the feet&mdash;and that hunt for a taxi, which has now
      taken the place of all other sport, was being prosecuted with more or less energy
      by a policeman, a loafer and two or three amateurs, all of whom returned at
      intervals while the packing-up was in progress, to say how hopeless the case was
      and how independent the men had become.</p>

      <p>One passing cab I hailed myself, but he did no more than laugh a loud laugh of
      mere incivility and ironically remark, "Ter-morrer!" signifying, as I understood
      it, that nothing on earth should interfere with his homeward journey that night,
      since he had done enough and was tired, but that on the succeeding day, if I still
      required his services, he was at my disposal.</p>

      <p>The various bags and parcels being now all ready, we waited patiently in the
      hall, and from time to time received reports as to the progress of the chase.</p>

      <p>At last, when things seemed really hopeless, a taxi arrived, driven by a young
      man in spectacles, which were, I am convinced, part of a disguise covering one of
      the noblest personalities in the land&mdash;some Haroun al Raschid, filled with
      pity for lost Londoners, who is devoting his life to redressing the wrongs
      inflicted upon poor humanity by taxi tyrants&mdash;for he said nothing about having
      no petrol, nothing about the lateness of the hour, nothing about the direction in
      which we wished to go, but quietly and efficiently helped to get the things in and
      on the cab; and then drove swiftly away, and when we got to the other end insisted
      on carrying some of the bundles up three flights of stairs, and had no objection to
      make when asked to wait a little longer and go on elsewhere.</p>

      <p>All this time I was, I need hardly say, in a dream. Could it be true? Could
      it?</p>

      <p>And when he was at last paid off he said both "Good night" and "Thank you,"
      although it was I in whom gratitude should have thus vocally burned. Perhaps it
      did; I was too dazed to remember.</p>

      <p>How I wish I had taken his number, that all the world might know it and look for
      it, assured of a gentleman on the box!</p>

      <h4>III.</h4>

      <p>So you see there are both kinds of taxi-drivers still&mdash;only the bad ones
      are more difficult to get hold of.</p>

      <h2>TO LORD RHONDDA.</h2>

      <p>DEAR LORD RHONDDA,&mdash;When you were an unassuming undergraduate at Caius
      College, spending your leisure-time in an eight- or a pair-oar, and stirring up the
      muddy shallows of the Cam, as you did to some purpose, I cannot believe that any
      premonitions of the heights of celebrity to which you would some day attain
      disturbed your mind. And yet here you are, a survivor from the foul and murderous
      shattering of the <i>Lusitania</i>, a coal-owner, a member of the Government, a
      peer, and the Food-Controller of a whole nation at war.</p>

      <p>Your predecessor, Lord DEVONPORT, had no very happy experience of the post you
      now hold, and I can well understand that his life during his tenure of it cannot
      have been a pleasant one. Every crank with an infallible recipe for catching
      sunbeams in cucumber-frames and turning them into potatoes, or whatever might be
      the fashionable food at the moment; every grumbler who imagined that every rise in
      prices must be entirely due to the malignity of men and not to the scarcity of the
      article; every politician with a grudge to satisfy or an axe to grind&mdash;all
      these pounced upon Lord DEVONPORT as a victim made ready to their hands, and gave
      him a time which can only be described as a very bad one. Add to this the mistakes
      almost necessarily made by an office which was entirely new and dealt with
      unexampled conditions, and it is not on the whole surprising that difficulties were
      encountered and that the right way for overcoming them was not always taken. Indeed
      there was or there seemed to be at one time a lively controversy between Lord
      DEVONPORT and Mr. PROTHERO about the true meaning of the words <i>maximum</i> and
      <i>minimum</i> as applied to prices, and we were left to infer that these Latin
      monsters are virtually indistinguishable from one another.</p>

      <p>However, all that is now over; Lord RHONDDA reigns in Lord DEVONPORT'S place and
      can profit by his experience. I don't want to delude you into the belief that all
      is plain sailing for you. You couldn't be made to believe that if I tried for a
      month of Sundays, and I don't mean to spend my time to no purpose. But I think the
      great body of the nation is determined that you shall have fair play and will
      support you through thick and thin in any policy, no matter how drastic, that you
      may recommend to their reason and their patriotism. This business of
      food-controlling is new to us as well as to you, but we are willing to be led, we
      are even willing to be driven, and we are grateful to you for having engaged your
      reputation and your skill and your firmness in the task of leading or driving us.
      And if in the course of your duty you encounter any genuine rascal endeavouring to
      grind the faces of the poor or to find his own profit in the misery of his
      fellow-men we look to you to give him short shrift.</p>

      Servant,</p>

      <h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

      <h3>THE ROYALTY TRIPLE BILL.</h3>

      <p>First a quite charming and, what is not so usual, a quite intelligible fantasy
      in mime&mdash;<i>The Magic Pipe</i>: Pierrot, faithless mistress, despair,
      sympathetic friend, adoring midinette, and so on. But Mr. JULES DELACRE, who played
      his own part, <i>Pierrot</i>, with a fine sincerity and a sense of the great
      tradition in this <i>genre</i>, got his effect across to us with an admirable
      directness. Miss PHYLLIS PINSON looking charming in a mid-Victorian Latin-Quarterly
      sort of way (which is a very nice way), danced seriously, fantastically,
      delightfully, and with quite astonishing command of her technique&mdash;the sort of
      thing that nine infallible managers out of ten who know what the public wants would
      condemn out of hand as impossible. The intelligent tenth must have been consoled by
      the enthusiastic applause which greeted the little piece. I have a fancy that mime
      would go far to restore sanity and tradition to the English stage, and every
      creditable essay in a delightful art deserves the fullest support.</p>

      <p>It is amusing to see our solemn Mr. JOHN GALSWORTHY in labour for three Acts
      over a rude joke. I frankly confess I enjoyed the joke. Cisterns (its theme) have
      no terrors for me even in mixed company. But the joke was not the really serious
      thing about <i>The Foundations</i>, a play that starts (some years hence) with a
      mob of starving people yelling outside the house&mdash;dear, stupid, kindly <i>Lord
      William Dromondy's</i> house. <i>Lord William</i> was a god of an infantry captain
      in the great War, and his four footmen&mdash;particularly <i>James</i>, the first
      of them&mdash;though revolutionaries at heart, are ready to stand between their
      master and any other revolutionaries in London town. Well, a bomb is found in the
      foundations of <i>Lord William's</i> Park Lane palace, and explodes to embarrassed
      laughter of shocked stall-holders in the Third Act.</p>

      <p>The plot's nothing, and the main joke, as I say, nothing to get excited over.
      But the whole effect of the tremendous trifle, admirably cast as it was, was
      diverting in the extreme.</p>

      <p>Of course it is like our Mr. GALSWORTHY to assume that things will be as black
      as ever a few years hence. 'Tis, no doubt, what encourages us to keep our end up in
      the great War. But we know the customs of leopards, and can forgive our pessimist
      for his creations (for all the world as if he were a milliner) of <i>Poulder, Lord
      William's</i> butler, rounded pillar of the eternal old order of things; of
      <i>James</i>, revolutionary but faithful (of course <i>James</i> never would in
      fact have kept this absurd job); of a light yellow pressman; of a feckless,
      torrentially eloquent plumber, whose solution of the class war was loving-kindness
      and the letting of the blood of all who were not kind.</p>

      <p>Mr. EADIE was a beloved vagabond of a plumber doing a fine part on his head, as
      is his way nowadays. But the thing is so good that it is perhaps ungracious to
      remind him he could make it better. Mr. SIDNEY PAXTON'S triumph with <i>Poulder</i>
      was his admirable restraint&mdash;rarest of accomplishments among comic stage
      butlers. The effect of everything was heightened by this excellent economy. It was
      a lesson in artistic reticence. An even more notable feat in the same kind was
      <i>The Press</i> of Mr. LAWRENCE HANRAY. Obviously he could have collected a good
      deal more of the laughter of the house if he had played less subtly. I should put
      it as quite the best piece of playing in a well-played piece. Mr. DAWSON MILWARD
      has made a deserved reputation as the strong silly ass. He sustained it&mdash;with
      something in hand. Mr. STEPHEN EWART'S <i>James</i> was a quite excellent
      performance, not very coherent and consistent in conception on the author's part,
      perhaps, and on that account all the more difficult. Miss ESM&Eacute; HUBBARD gave
      us pathos skilfully reserved in her clever study of an old, old countrywoman turned
      trousers-maker; and little DINKA STARACE showed quite astonishing aptitude (or the
      most wonderful training) in the part of her granddaughter. Miss BABS FARREN also
      did well with her rather intrusive part of <i>Lord William's</i> daughter.</p>

      <p><i>Box B</i>, by Mr. COSMO GORDON LENNOX, was just a gay trifle to send us home
      easy-minded to bed. <i>Bobby Stroud</i>, Zepp-strafer, kisses a pretty (oh, ever
      such a pretty!) widow by mistake. And continues by arrangement. Miss IRIS HOEY was
      really perfectly irresistible&mdash;something ought to be done about it. She would
      have reduced the whole Flying Corps to dereliction of duty. Mr. FRANK BAYLY had
      just that air of awkward modesty which is so much more effective than plain swank
      as an advertisement of gallantry, and Miss MURIEL POPE played a programme-girl with
      all the skill that an artist thinks is worth putting into little things.</p>

      <p>The best evening that I've had in the stalls since the War began ever so long
      ago.</p>

      <p>I should like to commend with extraordinarily little reserve Mr. FIELDING-HALL'S
      <i>The Way of Peace</i> (HURST AND BLACKETT) to the kind of reader that is drawing
      plans in his head for a New England. No wonder that in these great days the
      impatient idealist rushes forth with his bag of dreams. The author of <i>The Soul
      of a People</i> is extreme but sane&mdash;an extremist in common sense, say. He
      stakes on the fact of human solidarity as the cure for the bitternesses and
      crookednesses of politics; declares life and men to be good, not evil (how right he
      is!); wants an England rescued from the Puritans on the one hand and the mere
      musical comedians on the other; an England chaste because freer, less ignorant;
      good beer in easeful inns; the village or township as the unit of government and of
      fellowship; a return to music and the dance, not as a plasmon-fed high-brow
      proposition but as the natural expression of a joy of life returned; a clear fount
      of honour; a representative House of Commons; justice, respect, common sense and
      responsibility instead of charity; some place other than the streets for our young
      men and maidens to make love in; a recognition of crime as mainly a social, not an
      individual, disease; a law simplified and scales of justice not weighted against
      the poor; and a host of other good and wise and nearly possible things. Here is not
      the barren politics of manipulation but an ideal of living citizenship. I commend
      it to all believers in new days and all honourable disgruntlers; not perhaps as a
      programme but as a tonic.</p>
      <hr />

      <p>Do not, please, run away with the idea that <i>The Nursery</i> (HEINEMANN)
      presents us with Mr. EDEN PHILLPOTTS' views on baby culture. The background of his
      story, the scenes of which are laid in and around Colchester a year or so ago, is
      composed of gardens and oyster-beds. On these he gives a lot of information, and,
      as he could not be pedantic even if he tried to be, I browsed pleasantly upon the
      store of knowledge set before me. Also I liked the restraint he shows in dealing
      with the War, and commend his exemplary method to some of our more blatant
      novelists. When, however, I came to the inhabitants of <i>The Nursery</i> I failed
      to find in them that rare and delightful quality with which Mr. PHILLPOTTS usually
      succeeds in endowing his characters. Readers of his novels must know by this time
      that he is not exactly in love with <i>Mrs. Grundy</i>, but here he seems to be
      insurgent against something, and for the life of me I don't know quite what it is.
      Perhaps it is insincerity, which is a very good thing to be in rebellion against.
      There is one very amusing and delightful character, a bibulous old sinner who
      defied law and order and almost at the last gasp ladled out what he considered
      justice in a most dramatic manner. His name is <i>William Ambrose</i>, and it is
      worth your while to make his disreputable acqaintance.</p>
      <hr />

      <p>One fact at once awakened in me a fellow-feeling for Mr. BERTRAM SMITH&mdash;the
      discovery of his appreciation (shared by myself, the elder STEVENSON, and other
      persons of discernment) for the romantic possibilities of the map. There is an
      excellent map in the beginning of Days of Discovery (CONSTABLE), showing the
      peculiar domain of childhood, the garden, in terms that will hardly fail to win
      your sympathy. But not in this alone does Mr. SMITH show that he has the heart of
      the matter in him; every page of these reminiscences of nursery life proclaims a
      genuine memory, not a make-believe childhood faked up for literary ends. Who that
      has once been young can read unstirred by envy the chapter on "Devices and
      Contrivances," with its entrancing triumph of the chain of mirrors arranged (during
      the providential absence of those in authority) from the night nursery, down two
      flights of stairs, to the store-room in the basement? I know a reviewer whom
      nothing, but moral cowardice restrained from testing the possibility of this
      delightful plan by personal experiment. Fireworks too&mdash;Mr. SMITH has
      remembered them with a proper regard that is, of course, wholly different from that
      of those who understand them only in their pyrotechnic aspect, not as objects loved
      for themselves alone, for their shape and feel, and the glamour of weeks of
      hoarding and barter. In short, a real nursery book for the study; not one perhaps
      that actual children would care for (quite possibly they might resent it as
      betrayal), but one that for the less fortunate will reopen a door of which too many
      of us have long lost the key.</p>
      <hr />

      <p>What I found strangest in the <i>Transactions of Lord Louis Lewis</i> (MURRAY)
      is that it is a story, or rather series of stories, about rogues, in which trickery
      is invariably vanquished&mdash;a refreshing contrast to the methods of most of our
      romanticists, who are given to a certain courtier-like attitude towards the
      lawbreaker. Certainly that various artist, Mr. ROLAND PERTWEE, has contrived to put
      together a highly entertaining collection of diamond-cut-diamond yarns, adventure
      tales that have the great advantage (for these days) of being concerned, not with
      bloodshed and mysterious murders, but with the wiles of dealers in the spurious
      antique and the exploits of <i>Lord Louis</i> in defeating them. This <i>Lord
      Louis</i> is indeed a very pleasant as well as a very ingenious gentleman. From the
      rotundity of his conversational periods and a certain general suavity of demeanour
      I suspect him of having made a careful study of the methods of his distinguished
      predecessor in rogue-reducing, <i>Prince Florizel of Bohemia.</i> But he is, of
      course, none the worse company for that. Once, however, he shocked me badly, when,
      in perusing an eighteenth-century MS., he&mdash;I can hardly bring myself to quote
      the passage!&mdash;he "moistened his fingers and turned over three pages." And this
      of a nobleman and a connoisseur! Oh, Mr. PERTWEE! Having said so much, it is only
      fair that I should call your special attention to one of the stories, "The House in
      Bath," an exquisite little gem of considerably higher art than is usually
      associated with such "Exploits of the Event."</p>
      <hr />

      <p>You might perhaps allow yourself to be put off by such a title as <i>Home Truths
      about the War</i> (ALLEN), because it, or something like it, has so often been used
      as the preliminary to alarming or disagreeable statements that we have grown
      excusably suspicious. But to avoid on this account the letters that the Rev. HUGH
      CHAPMAN has here brought together would be to miss a very original and inspiring
      little book. Let me say once that Mr. CHAPMAN (whom you may know is energetic and
      popular chaplain of the Savoy; also as already, under a pseudonym, an author) has
      deliberately essayed the impossible. Self-revelation, especially in letters, can
      hardly ever be made convincing. But putting this on one side, and accepting these,
      not as the letters that would be written from one man to another, but rather (to
      speak without irreverence) such as the human heart might address to its Creator,
      you will find them full of interest and encouragement. All sorts and conditions of
      men and women are here shown, in their varied reaction to the great acid that for
      these three years past has been biting into the life of the world. The priest, the
      actor, the profiteer, the society-woman, even the conscientious objector, are all
      touched lightly, tactfully, and with a kindly humour that saves the book from its
      very obvious danger of becoming pedantic. In his brief preface Mr. CHAPMAN has
      crystallised very happily into a couple of words his ideal for the British attitude
      towards the War&mdash;buoyant sternness. It is the reflection of that quality in
      its pages that gives this little book its tonic value.</p>
      <hr />

      <p>Mr. ARNOLD WRIGHT'S main work in <i>Early English Adventurers in the East</i>
      (MELROSE) has been that of making good. Most of us know something, at any rate, of
      the men who brought our Eastern Empire into actual existence, but I tell myself
      hopefully that my ignorance of those daring pioneers, whom Mr. WRIGHT describes as
      humble adventurers of the seventeenth century, is not exceptional. It has now been
      satisfactorily removed, and, after reading this excellently written history of
      stirring deeds, I must believe that even men of learning will thank him for
      rescuing many good names from the oblivion which threatened them. And Mr. WRIGHT is
      not only to be congratulated on this act of salvage, but also on the admirable way
      in which he has performed it. A restrained style and a temperate judgment are
      equally at his command. I cannot better commend his book to Imperialists than by
      saying that all Little Englanders will detest it.</p>
      <hr />

      <p>On internal evidence I had set down <i>Root and Branch</i> (ALLEN AND UNWIN), by
      R. ALLATINI, as the very clever first book of a very clever and observant writer of
      the (alleged) weaker sex. But I find the title-page gives two previous novels to
      her pen&mdash;I still guess a woman's hand. And I by no means withdraw the
      "clever." The characterisation of the various members of the <i>Arenski</i>
      family&mdash;the branches are better done than the root, old <i>Paul Arenski,
      K.C.</i>, idealist and orator&mdash;is uncannily good. There's wit and humour and
      diversity of gifts. What suggested the "first book" idea was an uncertainty of
      method, a hesitation between the new realism and the older romanticism. In both
      moods the author is successful, but the joints show something clumsily. This,
      however, is technical merely. I commend the book to all who are interested,
      approvingly or critically, in the Jew. A dramatic theme runs through the book, the
      ethical question as to whether a man may be justified in killing, at her passionate
      request, a woman dearly loved who is slowly dying of a terrible disease.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
